## Potential Games to try
* Growlanser 3 [^1]

## Others
`sp193` on Assembler Games mentions that the Sound module also has debug information in it [^1]:
```
The OSDSND module from the Protokernel boot ROM (SCPH-10000 and SCPH-15000) also has debugging information left over in it. 
This module is actually the tentative sound driver library (librspu2) that was mentioned within the SONY SDK, and was the predecessor to libsd. 
The funny thing is that the one in the expansion-bay boot ROMs is newer than the one that comes in the Sony PS2SDK (even in release v3.02).
```


l_oliveira on the same Assembler Games forum topic states that most of the games with debug symbols were compiled with the earlier 2.x.x SDK rather than the later 3.x.x SDK [^1]. 
He then goes on to mention an interesting tidbit about Arcade code still having debug symbols in it, even when they strip the Ps2 version of the same game (e.g Konami).

Also the IRX I/O processor modules rarely if ever have any debug symbols due to most games not developing their own IOP modules and the limit of the 2MB memory for the modules [^1].

## Interesting Notes

### Piposaru 2001 (Japan)
Piposaru 2001 contains two IOPRP*.IMG files (IOPRP205.IMG and IOPRP214.IMG) so presumably both 2.0.5 and 2.1.4 versions of the PS2SDK were used during development. In the MCMAN.IRX the string `PsIImcman   2020` exists which suggests it was built using PS2SDK version 2.0.2. In the main binary elf file it also mentions `PsIIlibkernl2050` again suggesting 2.0.5. I have marked the game as using 2.1.4 since that is the most recent version used.
