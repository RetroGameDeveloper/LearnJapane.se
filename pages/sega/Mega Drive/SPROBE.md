Developed for Electronic Arts in 1989, the SPROBE combines a Sega Megadrive and a development board. 

Latching onto the Megadrive cart interface, it adds a cartridge emulator as well as a debug / development capability using a PC card link. 

This hardware is one of the reasons for EA's early dominance in Sega Genesis gaming.
