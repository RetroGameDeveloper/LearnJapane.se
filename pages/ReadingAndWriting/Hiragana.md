Hiragana contains 42 characters.

# Vowels
There are 5 vowels in Hiragana:
* あ - Ah (Think apple)
* い - I (Think of two i's) but seems to be pronounces as eee (long e sound)
* う - U/ew (Think of a boxer getting punched in stomach and the noise it would make)
* え - Eh (Think of an energetic Ninja)
* お - Oh (Think of a UFO)

# Ah vs Oh or あ vs お
The difference in the symbol can be subtle but look for the floating symbol in the top right of お (Oh).
お (oh) is used at the start of characters to imply politeness.
あ (ah) is used at the end of characters.

# い (I) Stomach
い is actually a word by itself to mean Stomach, and its pronounced like an E like eeeat.
