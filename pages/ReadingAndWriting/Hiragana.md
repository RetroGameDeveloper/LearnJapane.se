# Hiragana Introduction
Hiragana contains 46 characters, it is used for actual japanese words unlike Katagana which is used for loan words from other languages.

## Kana
Both Hiragana and Katagana together are known as Kana.

## Contains every pronouncable japanese character
```
Hiragana is the basic Japanese phonetic alphabet. It represents every sound in the Japanese language. Therefore, you can theoretically write everything in hiragana. However, because Japanese is written with no spaces, this will create nearly indecipherable text.

## Furigana
You can use Hiragana as little small notes beside a Kanji character to tell you how to pronounce it, this use of Hiragana is called `furigana`.

# Vowels
There are 5 vowels in Hiragana:
* あ - Ah (Think apple)
* い - eee (Think of two i's) but seems to be pronounces as eee (long e sound)
* う - oo/ew (Think of a boxer getting punched in stomach and the noise it would make like Oof without the f)
* え - Eh (Think of an (eh)nergetic Ninja) ignore the n
* お - Ou (Think of a UFO)

## Ah vs Oh or あ vs お
The difference in the symbol can be subtle but look for the floating symbol in the top right of お (Oh).
お (oh) is used at the start of characters to imply politeness.
あ (ah) is used at the end of characters.

## い (I) Stomach
い is actually a word by itself to mean Stomach, and its pronounced like an E like eeeat.

## When you put Ah and eee together it produced LOVE
* あい (aye) = Love

## oo and Eh makes UP, UP and ABOVE!
* うい (ooeh) = Up or Above

## ee and Eh creates NO!
Think of Grumpy cat saying No, but instead saying eeeeeh (いいえ).
* いいえ (eeeeeh) - No

## BLUE! - AhOuEe (あおい)
* あおい - Blue

# Hiragana K Column
There are 5 consonents in the  K-column of Hiragana:
* か - Kah (Think of a Sword Cutting a Stick) (Question Mark particle)
* き - Ki (Think of )
* く - Ku
* け - Ke
* こ - Ko

## Questions? か = ? (Kah)uestions
* か (kah) is the question mark particle in japanese, so you won't see the standard ? symbol after a question you will instead see か.

# Hiragana H Column

A Good tip from `Kori Chan` on Youtube is:
```
Between "ha" and "ho" you can see that the right part of ほ looks like it says "ho" horizontally
```
