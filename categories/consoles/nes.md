# Introduction
Interested in learning more about the the NES? Excellent! This section will guide you through the basics, starting from basic assembly language all the way to an introduction to reverse engineering your first game!


## Super Mario 'compiler'
The website `neilb.net` has created what it calls a `Mario Compiler` which takes in the original Super Mario Bros ROM and dissassembles it.
The disassembled code is then shown to the user and can then be modified and re-assembled back into a working NES ROM.
